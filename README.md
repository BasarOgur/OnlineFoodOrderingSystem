# Online Food Ordering System

## Project Description
The aim of our project is to allow users to order food easily. In order to achieve this goal, we started by creating a database using MySQL. Once we created these tables, we inserted some values to them that would serve as the base of our operations. Then, we started working on our Python code which would allow the user to enter specified information in order to make an order or add, update, and delete certain things. Finally, when the change is done it changes on the database as well.
